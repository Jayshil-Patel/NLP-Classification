# Creating a Branch in a GitHub Repository

Branching is an essential feature in Git that allows you to work on multiple versions of a repository at the same time. Here are the steps to create a branch in a GitHub repository:

1. Go to the GitHub repository where you want to create a branch.

2. Click on the "Branch" button, which is located in the top right corner of the repository.

3. In the "Branch" field, type the name for your new branch.

4. Click the "Create branch" button to create your new branch.

5. Now, you can start making changes to the new branch, and when you are ready, you can submit a pull request to merge your changes back into the main branch.

6. You can switch between branches by clicking on the branch name in the "Branch" drop-down menu.

By following these steps, you can easily create a new branch in a GitHub repository and start working on it independently from the main branch.
