"This pattern occurs in all relationships and is often observed in marriage, where, by various kinds of behavior, each partner seeks to control the other. The muscular mechanism basic to the achievement of autonomy is the mechanism of holding on and letting go. By the employment of it, the individual begins to be aware of his powers as a separate person.

For her great love the uttermost shall proffer Of honour, wealth, and earthly joy and bliss, With her to love, my heart will never miss Those who no gifts like her gifts have to offer. She the fulfilment is of my desire, Therefore I vow myself her true esquire; She'll love me in return--my splendid meed-- If I but love aright in word and deed. and one of his rather more religious songs ends as follows: Without true love there is on earth no peace, Love gives us wisdom, faith which will not swerve,",Emil Lucka,The Evolution of Love

There is in me such a tumult of life that frequently after an outburst my spirit and soul are left in such weariness that I seem to be on the point of death.

"sturdily fighting for their convictions. The fundamental ideal of these reformers was the suppression of the outward pomp of the Church and the return to the simplicity of the gospels. Their fates varied. The gentle St. Francis of Assisi was canonised; the illumined Eckhart, on the other hand, was tortured; most of them, like the ardent Arnold of Brescia, were burnt at the stake. This conduct of the hierarchy towards the truly religious men is easily explained. The Church was faced by a problem; on the one hand, the genuine and profound piety of these men was unmistakable, but on",Emil Lucka,The Evolution of Love
"a matter of fact, these words branded and contradicted the merely subjective emotional mysticism; to the emotional mystic salvation lies in the ""absorption in God,"" in shapeless, thoughtless contemplation. Richard of St. Victor, founding his theories on St. Bernard, established six stages of meditation. The Franciscan monk, Bonaventura, the famous author of the _Biblia Pauperum_, added a seventh, a complete rest in God--""like the Sabbath after the six days of labour.""

But from the very beginning it was misunderstood; the salvation of the world was linked to the person of a man who had aspired to be an example to the whole race. The term, ""Son of God,"" was understood in the sense of the hero-cult of antiquity; possibly the Jewish faith in a Messiah, the politico-national hope of the Children of Israel, was a good deal to blame for this.

Art, literature, music, all the enthusiasm and profound thought of which the human mind is capable, were pressed into her service. Independent thought was heresy, and the death of every heretic became a new fetter which bound the intellect of man.

We find the first germs of the new creative principle of personality in the Platonic figure of Socrates who, first of all, conceived the idea of a higher spiritual love, blended it with the love of ideas and separated it sharply from base desire. Though his conception was not yet personal love in the true sense, it was nevertheless a spiritual divine love. The Greek State could not tolerate him, and sentenced him to death. But this same Socrates also said (in ""Crito"") that man was indebted to the State for his existence. ""Did not thy father, in obedience",Emil Lucka,The Evolution of Love

"most sacred relic in the world, the Holy Grail. The time was ripe for a great event, a universal and overwhelming enterprise which could absorb the passionate longing. Maybe that the wisdom of the great popes--half unconsciously, certainly, and under the pressure of the age, but yet led by an unerring instinct--guided this stream into the bed of the Church; the vague craving found a definite object: the Crusades were organised.

How much more, then, are they to be regarded as raving madmen who imagine that they know the secrets of nature, which will never be revealed to human inquisitiveness?""

"yearning for art, for poetry, for beauty, began to stir the hearts of men and women. It found expression in the ideal of chivalry, the Holy Sepulchre and the Holy Grail, and suddenly love, bursting out in a brilliant flame, shed its radiance on the sordid relationship which had hitherto existed between the sexes, and transfigured it. Woman, the despised, to whom at the Council of Macon a soul had been denied, all at once became a queen, a goddess. The drudge, the patiently suffering wife, were things of the past. A new ideal had been set up and men",Emil Lucka,The Evolution of Love
"Viscountess Ermengarde, of Narbonne, the problem whether the love between husband and wife or the love between lovers were the greater, was decided as follows: ""The affection between a married couple and the tender love which unites two lovers are emotions which differ fundamentally and according to custom. It would be folly to attempt a comparison between two subjects which neither resemble each other, nor have any connection."" A husband declared: ""It is true, I have a beautiful wife, and I love her with conjugal love.

"instincts are at play.) It frequently occurs that lovers commit suicide together because external circumstances prevent their union. This is a step corresponding to suicide from offended vanity or incurable disease; life has become unbearable to the individual haunted by a fixed idea, and he throws it away. But this has nothing whatever to do with the love-death; it is a purely negative act of despair, whereas the love-death is an altogether positive act, namely, the will to win to a higher (and to the intellect inconceivable and paradoxical) metaphysical unity. The love-death aspires to perform a miracle. It has,",Emil Lucka,The Evolution of Love

At other times all sensuous perceptions disappear simultaneously; body and hands grow rigid and it seems as if the soul had left the body, which is scarcely breathing. This condition is of short duration. The rigidity passes away to some extent, the body slowly regains life, the breath comes and goes, only to die away again and thus endow the soul with greater freedom.

At last the fundamental consciousness of Christianity had triumphed: the principle of the ""Son-of-Godship"" inspired the soul of the mystics; in future religion must emanate from the soul and find its goal in God; written documents and--in the case of the profoundest thinkers--examples were no longer needed. The heretical sects had been content to reject post-evangelical tradition, in order to lay greater stress on the words of Christ.

The grateful hearts of the people surrounded the name of St. Francis with legends; the study of his life inspired Giotto, the father of the new art, to the study of plant and animal life.

She was loved and adored with a devotion not of this earth, a devotion which was the sole source of all things lofty and good; she had become the saviour of humanity and queen of the universe.

For this reason the work, although the fundamental idea is not erotic, is entitled to be placed by the side of _Tristan_ with its demand for the absolute metaphysical consummation of love. It is an amazing fact that the same genius should have experienced and portrayed both stages so perfectly.

"the erotic life stands Christianity, which, in sharp contrast to antiquity and to the classical period, sought the centre and climax of life in the soul. The founder of the ""religion of love"" _discovered_ the individual, and by so doing laid the foundation for that metaphysical love which found its most striking expression in the deification of woman and the cult of the Virgin Mary.

"In the same way Greeks and Romans did not attach very much importance to life; suicide was very common, and frequently committed without any special motive. As true love is based on personality, it is impossible for the modern East-Asiatic to know love in our sense. Lowell agrees with this: ""Love, as we understand it, is an unknown feeling in the East.""

Conspicuous amongst these is St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who in his _Sermones in Canticum_ took the ""Song of Songs"" as a base for mystically-sexual imaginings. There is nothing really new in this direction. But I will cite a few stanzas written by St. Bernard which might equally well have come from one of the amorous nuns: TO THE SIDE-WOUND OF CHRIST.

Tristan and Isolde, Lancelot and Guinevere, Fleur and Blanchefleur--these were the admired and mythical lovers of whom the poets sang and dreamed.

On the contrary, it is a characteristic of genuine love that the physical embrace is of no great importance, does not even rise to full consciousness. The personality of the beloved is everything, physical sensation nothing. Weininger identifies love with passion and his argument is easily refutable by the experience of many. In love there is neither means nor end; if, however, categoric formulas must be used, one might speak of a reciprocal action. Equally erroneous is his corresponding assertion that the artist loves a",Emil Lucka,The Evolution of Love

The enjoyment of beauty as a separate element pre-supposes a conscious, spiritual division, not only of the beloved, but also of the lover, and is therefore the destruction of the principle of unity.

There is no question of a division when Tristan in his vision of Isolde exclaims, ""How beautiful thou art!"" For great love can create the beauty of the beloved out of its own soul.

Another rung of the ladder of evolution had been climbed--the mistress had become queen of the world and goddess, a being enthroned by the side of God. I will again quote Guinicelli: Ever as she walks she has a sober grace, Making bold men abashed and good men glad, If she delight thee not, thy heart must err, No man dare look on her, his thoughts being base; Nay, let me say even more than I have said, No man could think base thoughts who looked on her.",Emil Lucka,The Evolution of Love
