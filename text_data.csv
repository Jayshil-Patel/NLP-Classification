The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings. âAre you better now, sir?â said she. I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, âI believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still",Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,Frankenstein

But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known",Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,Frankenstein

Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice. âGod knows,â she said, âhow entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful",Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,Frankenstein

But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no need of the carpenterâs box: and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;âat a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred.

As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to",Herman Melville,Moby-Dick

I shall certainly go,â said NatÃ¡sha decisively. âDaniel, tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my dogs,â she added to the huntsman. It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible. He cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business, careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"a rather steep incline which dominated the French position. Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the dragoons. In the center, where TÃºshinâs battery stood and from which Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from SchÃ¶n Grabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides. Behind our position was",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"let his head sink still lower. Langeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrotherâs vanity as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what they might. âIf he could attack us, he would have done so today,â said he. âSo you think he is powerless?â said Langeron. âHe has forty thousand men at most,â replied Weyrother, with the smile of a doctor",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a spot on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden. âHurry up, you others!â he called out to his comrades. âItâs getting hot.â When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat. âThere is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!â",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"battle, and though still holding their positions they had lost ONE HALF of their army. The French, with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleonâs invincibility, with the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact, twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. The French who had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its position ought to have made that effort, for as long as the Russians continued to block",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace

He is very attentive to her.â âHe visits them?â âYes, very often. And do you know the new way of courting?â said Pierre with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary. âNo,â replied Princess Mary. âTo please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy.

Here is a letter to Prince VasÃ­li, and here is money. Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.â Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead. âBut he must be a Freemason,â said he, referring to the abbÃ© whom he had met that evening. âThat is all",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"LÃ¡zarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers embraced him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of Russian and French voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square. Two officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by RostÃ³v. âWhat dâyou think of the treat? All on silver plate,â one of them was saying. âHave you seen LÃ¡zarev?â âI have.â âTomorrow, I hear, the PreobrazhÃ©nskis will give them a dinner.â âYes, but what luck for LÃ¡zarev!

But, to his surprise, BalashÃ«v received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine with the Emperor that day. BessiÃ¨res, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner. Napoleon met BalashÃ«v cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no sign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning, but, on the contrary, tried to reassure BalashÃ«v. It was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right,",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace

The fact that he did not, as she had feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away. The morning after little Nicholas had left,",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace

It was as if the thread of the chief screw which held his life together were stripped, so that the screw could not get in or out, but went on turning uselessly in the same place.

"part of a nationâshould oblige that whole nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated. So according to history it has been found from the most ancient times, and so it is to our own day. All Napoleonâs wars serve to confirm this rule. In proportion to the defeat",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"wailing of women was heard from different sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing. âOh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Donât let me die! My good souls!...â Five minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen.
