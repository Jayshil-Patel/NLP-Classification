Every one knows what a multitude of thingsâbeds, sauce-pans, knives and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which necessitates a three-yearsâ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to",Herman Melville,Moby-Dick

For, dâye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions.

Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this only the more affected some of them, because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar tones",Herman Melville,Moby-Dick

Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.

Both these results follow when another division is made, and when all the smallest genera, with from only one to four species, are absolutely excluded from the tables. These facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties; for wherever many species of the same genus have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression, the manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find the manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason to believe the process",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species

This seems to be mainly due to the reproductive system being eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life; so that this system, when not rendered impotent, fails to reproduce offspring exactly like the parent-form.

The same result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the medicinal leech.

But I will pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty; for I believe that many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas; though I do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous has played an important part in the formation of new species, more especially with freely-crossing and wandering animals.

"she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored NatÃ¡sha to life. A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within. NatÃ¡shaâs wound healed in that",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace

Why do you come in without being called?â cried Nicholas, quickly changing his attitude. âFrom the governor,â said LavrÃºshka in a sleepy voice. âA courier has arrived and thereâs a letter for you.â âWell, all right, thanks. You can go!â Nicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother and the other from SÃ³nya. He recognized them by the handwriting and opened SÃ³nyaâs first.

Nicholasâ letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who saw an intervention of Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas. âI was never pleased at BolkÃ³nskiâs engagement to NatÃ¡sha,â said the countess, âbut I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!â",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace

He replied to questions they put to him, but did not consider who was listening to his replies, nor how they would understand them. He looked at their faces and figures, but they all seemed to him equally meaningless.

Not only Princess Mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old âPrince Nicholasâ (as his grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his arms, and Michael IvÃ¡novich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.

Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbÃ© about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young manâs simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna PÃ¡vlovna disapproved. âThe means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people,â the abbÃ© was saying. âIt is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russiaâbarbaric as she is said to beâto place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace

Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shuddered at the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations, stood still. The smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing anything for an instant, but there was no second report as he had expected.

He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white hand he held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them as they entered.

The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room.

"moral qualities opinions differ widely, history shows us that neither a Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled over millions of people, had any particular moral qualities, but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled over.
