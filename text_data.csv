Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the whaleâs unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the logâ_shoals, rocks,",Herman Melville,Moby-Dick

High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs.

Of such a letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy. âCanâst not read it?â cried Ahab. âGive it me, man.

"conclusive, that the several domestic breeds of Pigeon have descended from one wild species, I compared young pigeons of various breeds, within twelve hours after being hatched; I carefully measured the proportions (but will not here give details) of the beak, width of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg, in the wild stock, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons, carriers, and tumblers. Now some of these birds, when mature, differ so extraordinarily in length and form of beak, that they would, I cannot doubt, be ranked in distinct genera, had they been",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species
"undergone during whole geological periods but little modification, there is not much difficulty in believing that they may have migrated from the same region; for during the vast geographical and climatal changes which will have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of migration is possible. But in many other cases, in which we have reason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced within comparatively recent times, there is great difficulty on this head. It is also obvious that the individuals of the same species, though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions, must have proceeded from",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species
"much modified, that if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would not have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, whether they had descended from this species or from some other allied species, such as C. oenas. So with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed directly intermediate between them, but between each and an unknown common parent. The common parent will have had in its",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species

Before entering on the subject of this chapter, I must make a few preliminary remarks, to show how the struggle for existence bears on Natural Selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that amongst organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability; indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed. It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or three hundred doubtful forms of British plants are",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species

For animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may readily become adapted to similar conditions, and thus assume a close external resemblance; but such resemblances will not revealâwill rather tend to conceal their blood-relationship to their proper lines of descent. We can also understand the apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when one class or order is compared with another, but give true affinities when the members of the same",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species

But I could show that none of these characters of instinct are universal. A little dose, as Pierre Huber expresses it, of judgment or reason, often comes into play, even in animals very low in the scale of nature. Frederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared instinct with habit. This comparison gives, I think,",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species

The law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically distinct, to be closely allied to those of the nearest continent, we sometimes see displayed on a small scale, yet in a most interesting manner, within the limits of the same archipelago. Thus the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago are tenanted, as I",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species
"few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretel that it will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species

Consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall in a future chapter attempt to show, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record. _On the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar habits and structure_.âIt has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold, how, for instance, a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into one with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transitional state",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species
"allied forms have apparently migrated from the north to the south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however, a few southern vegetable forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia. I suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed in their own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been advanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection or dominating power, than the southern forms. And thus, when they became commingled during the Glacial period, the",Charles Darwin,The Origin of Species

If then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent always ready to act and select, why should we doubt that variations in any way useful to beings, under their excessively complex relations of life, would be preserved, accumulated, and inherited?

We know not at all precisely what are all the conditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant species; but we can, I think, clearly see that a number of individuals, from giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations, and that severe competition with many already existing forms, would be highly favourable, as would be the power of spreading into new territories.

The degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is governed by several curious and complex laws. It is generally different, and sometimes widely different, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species. It is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the hybrid produced from this cross.

Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical; thus cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf; colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many remarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants. From the facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are differently affected from coloured individuals by certain vegetable poisons.

As the warmth returned, these temperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains, being exterminated on the lowlands; those which had not reached the equator, would re-migrate northward or southward towards their former homes; but the forms, chiefly northern, which had crossed the equator, would travel still further from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite hemisphere.

Our army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at PultÃºsk and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting the Emperorâs arrival and the beginning of a new campaign. The PÃ¡vlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign. It had been neither at PultÃºsk",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"cooled even at night. Some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road. The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded sky. There was no wind, and the men",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"now, what about your Roi de Prusse?â Hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing. âOh, itâs nothing. I only wished to say...â (he wanted to repeat a joke he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to get in) âI only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le Roi de Prusse!â BorÃ­s smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical or appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody laughed. âYour joke is too bad, itâs witty but unjust,â said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, shaking her little shriveled",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"Beaumarchais, and others? Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to KazÃ¡n and Siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of IvÃ¡n the Terrible and by his correspondence with KÃºrbski? Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies? For us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without leaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit, remains incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"if possible. With a womanâs involuntary loving cunning she, who till then had not shown any alarm, said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night. Without any pretense she was now afraid of everything. CHAPTER XIV Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the countessâ fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit dealerâs in MyasnÃ­tski Street. When returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop. She had taken a cab and",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"order, geniusâthatâs what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France. When I understood what he wantedâwhen I saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: âThat is a monarch,â and I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"at all. What can doctors cure? One canât cure anything. Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies. Our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.â And having entered on the path of",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event. As soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event, the replies they give immediately lose all meaning, for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways. One historian says that an event was produced by Napoleonâs power, another that it was produced by Alexanderâs, a third that it was due to the power of some other person. Besides this, historians of that kind contradict",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"KutÃºzovâs courtyard. The voices were those of the orderlies who were packing up; one voice, probably a coachmanâs, was teasing KutÃºzovâs old cook whom Prince Andrew knew, and who was called Tit. He was saying, âTit, I say, Tit!â âWell?â returned the old man. âGo, Tit, thresh a bit!â said the wag. âOh, go to the devil!â called out a voice, drowned by the laughter of the orderlies and servants. âAll the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this mist!â CHAPTER",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
"cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first, and those who like MÃ­tenka held promissory notes given them as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors. Nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace, and those who had seemed to pity the old manâthe cause of their losses (if they were losses)ânow remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them. Not one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold by auction for half its value, and half the debts still remained",Leo Tolstoy,War and Peace
